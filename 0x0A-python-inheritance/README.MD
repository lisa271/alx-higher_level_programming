Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

Prototype: def lookup(obj):
Returns a list object

Write a class MyList that inherits from list:

Public instance method: def print_sorted(self): that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
You can assume that all the elements of the list will be of type int
